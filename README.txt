<h2>Welcome To Mathematical and Physics Conversion Units</h2>
<p>In Mathematics and physics, it is required to convert the units while solving many problems. To carry out the required calculations, mathematical conversions are needed. For example, to find the area of a triangle, if a base is given in cm, and height is given in meter, and you are asked to find the area of a triangle in cm, it is necessary to convert the height in meters into centimetres. Therefore, it is necessary to learn the conversion of units, to convert a unit into the required unit.</p>
<p>Similarly in Physics, to calculate the speed of an object over a certain distance moved in kilometers or miles you have to convert that distance in meters as meters is the S.I units of speed.</p>  

<h3>What is Conversion of Units?</h3>
<p>The use of a unit depends on the situation, such as the area of a room is expressed in meters but the length of a pencil is expressed in centimetres and its thickness in mm.</p>

<p>Thus, we need to convert one unit to another. Before understanding the concept of conversion of units we need to understand the relationship between units.</p>

<h3>Length and Mass conversion</h3>
<p>Mensuration is an ancient concept. Every physical quantity like length, mass, time, temperature etc, have a specific unit. By definition, a unit is a magnitude of a physical quantity.</p>

<h3>Importance of Mathematical Conversions</h3>
<p>In order to have accuracy and avoid confusion in measurement, we need to convert one unit to another. For instance, we do not measure the length of a pencil in kilometres, in such case one have to convert kilometre (km) to centimetre (cm). Generally, the conversion of one unit to another unit of the same quantity is performed using multiplicative conversion factors. Letâ€™s see how to convert a different unit of length and mass.</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>This is a simple html where everything has been designed for you. just call the index.html and ensure that all files and the css directory they are in the root folder.
